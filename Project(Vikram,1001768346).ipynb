    "The CNN Moneyâ€™s Market Movers website (https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ ) tracks the most active stocks on a real time basis.  Specifically, the most active, the top gainers and top losers are listed at any instance in time. You will first write Python scripts that collect the list of most actives, gainers and losers from the above website. Next, your programs should take the ticker symbols and names of these companies (and categories) and build a csv file (called stocks.csv) with data about each stock from the website: \n",
    "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD? , which gives the quote for ticker symbol AMD as an example. \n",
    "Or, you can also use the stock info page from CNN website: \n",
    "https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=GE , which gives the quote for ticker symbol GE as an example. \n",
    "The data to be collected from the Yahoo Finance site should include: \n",
    "\n",
    "OPEN price\n",
    "\n",
    "PREV CLOSE price \n",
    "\n",
    "VOLUME \n",
    "\n",
    "MARKET CAP\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should also list the names of the companies in the order and categories listed in the website: https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/ and ask the user to choose a company to get the data on. Once the user chooses the company of interest, your program should display its corresponding data (Open, Prev Close, Volume and Market Cap).\n",
